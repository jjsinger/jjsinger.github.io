<center><b>Statsing</b>deploying machine learning models</center>

## About
My name is Josh Singer and I graduated BYU with a degree in Applied Statistics & Analytics. A common problem among many statisticians is learning statistical methods, but not having the knowledge on how to deploy them! This is a blog dedicated to understanding the intricacies of the data science pipeline including scraping, storing, visualizing, modeling, and deploying statistical analyses and machine learning models. While most of my modeling experience is in R, I've been exploring Python for it's compatibility.
