## About
Hi, my name is Josh Singer and I graduated BYU with a degreed in Applied Statistics & Analytics. A common problem many statisticians run into is learning methods, but have no knowledge on how to deploy them! This is a blog dedicated to Understanding the intracacies of the data science pipeline including scraping, pulling, storing, visualizing, modeling, and deploying statisical analyses and machine learning models. While most of my modeling was done in R I'm slowly getting into Python for it's compatibility.
